            Food is the source of energy that provides man with energy needed to do his job.
            
            In the past, man did not need to take his food with him, relying on hunting and picking fruits and eating tree leaves. But as man evolved and his diet changed, he began taking food with him to work or to the field.
            
            With the changing of man professions and being forced to work away from home. It became necessary to carry his food with him every time he is out to work.

            Serious competition leaded to restaurants development. Each restaurant quickly developed itself and services to acquire customers.
